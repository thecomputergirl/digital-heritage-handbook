Userscripts are little Javascript programs that run inside your web browser. They're triggered when you visit specified websites, and can change the way these sites look and behave. Userscripts give you the power to customise your own web experience.

## Installation

To run userscripts it's best to have a script manager installed. Userscript managers are available as browser extensions:

* [Greasemonkey <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) -- works with Firefox
* [Tampermonkey <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://tampermonkey.net/) -- works with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and other browsers

Choose an appropriate manager and install it according to the requirements of your browser.

Once your script manager is installed you can browse sites like [GreasyFork <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://greasyfork.org/en) looking for useful scripts. [This one <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1317-download-youtube-videos-as-mp4), for example, adds a download button to YouTube. Just click on the green 'Install' button to add it to your browser.

You can also share userscripts as Gists. Just click on the 'Raw' button and your script manager will ask you if you want to install the script.
