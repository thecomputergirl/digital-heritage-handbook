There's lots of interesting data available through our cultural heritage institutions. I regularly harvest content for research and teaching from the [Trove API](http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove), as well as less accessible sources such as [RecordSearch](https://github.com/wragge/recordsearch_tools). Here's a list of some of my pre-harvested datasets for you to use and enjoy.

* [Faces extracted from Trove newspaper photographs, 1880-1912](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2060052.v1)
* [Radio National programs, 2000-2014 (via Trove)](https://github.com/wragge/radio-national-data)
* [Commonwealth Hansard, House of Representatives, 1901-1965](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml)
* [Front pages of *The Gadfly*, 1906-1909](https://github.com/wragge/gadfly-demo)
* [Files in the National Archives of Australia withheld from public access in 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2060052.v1)
